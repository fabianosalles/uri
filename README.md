# URI Online Judge's Problems Solutions
[URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/) is a website wich publishes various Computer Science problems you can solve in the programming language you prefer.

This repository contains some of my solutions and thoughts about the problems I've found interesting for one reason or another. Nothing fancy, just an old-timer programmer practicing and having some fun.  

Most of the code is written in C and compiled under a Debian Linux using gcc, but some C++ and JavaScript are present.

## Organization of this Repository
Each folder contains the problem description, one or more solutions and, sometimes, data files to run tests.

## Important
You can, but shouldn't use the code as it is as the proposal of sites like URI is to teach and challenge you to find your own solution.

That's it.
